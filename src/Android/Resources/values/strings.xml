  <string name="AutoFillServiceDescription">
    It can be difficult and insecure for users to switch between apps to copy/paste username and password information
    from their Cozy Pass vault.\n\nUsing this accessibility service allows Cozy Pass to detect and read input fields on
    your device\'s screen. Whenever Cozy Pass detects a password field on the screen a notification will appear that allows
    you to quickly access your Cozy Pass vault and automatically fill (auto-fill) the correct login information into the
    necessary fields.
